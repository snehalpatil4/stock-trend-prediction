                              STOCK   MARKET  TREND PREDICTION

In the past decades, there is an increasing interest in predicting markets among       economists, policymakers, academics and market makers. 

The objective of the proposed work is to study and improve the supervised learning algorithms to predict the stock price.

There are 50 stocks in Nifty.From which we have chosen KOTAKBANK dataset.

The NIFTY 50 is a benchmark Indian stock market index that represents the weighted average of 50 of the 
largest Indian companies listed on the National Stock Exchange.

The prediction of a stock market direction may serve as an early recommendation system for short-term investors and as an early financial distress warning system for long-term shareholders.

Forecasting accuracy is the most important factor in selecting any forecasting methods.

Research efforts in improving the accuracy of forecasting models are increasing since the last decade. 

The appropriate stock selections those are suitable for investment is a very difficult task. 

The key factor for each investor is toÂ  earn maximum profits on their investments.

Algorithms Used in this project: 

1)Decision Tree
2)Naive Bayes Classifier
3) KNN K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)

Comparison of all algorithms on KOTAKBANK.csv Dataset:
